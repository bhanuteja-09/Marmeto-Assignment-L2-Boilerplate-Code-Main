Project Clarification - Coding Assessment L-2
Overview

This project is my submission for the Coding Assessment L-2. The goal of this assessment was to create a responsive web page that showcases product cards based on different categories (Men, Women, Kids). The project includes functionality to switch between categories using tabs and displays corresponding product cards dynamically.

Features Implemented:

Tabs for Categories:
Implemented tabs for Men, Women, and Kids categories.
Clicking on each tab updates the displayed product cards accordingly.

Product Cards:
Each product card includes an image, title, vendor, price, compare at price, and discount percentage.
Prices are displayed in the format "$XX.XX".

Dynamic Data Rendering:
Fetched product data from an API.
Calculated discount percentages and displayed them on the product cards.

Styling:
Applied responsive design principles for different screen sizes.
Added hover effects on product cards and buttons for better user interaction.
Utilized CSS for styling, including gradients, shadows, and font properties.
Implemented grayscale effect on category icons (emojis) when inactive.

Project Structure:
The project structure includes the following main files:

index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the web page.
style.css: Manages the styling of the elements.
